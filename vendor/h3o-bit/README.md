This is a low-level library that assumes that you know what you're doing (there
are no guardrails: garbage-in, garbage-out).

Unless you're implementing algorithms/data structures for H3 indexes, you should
be using [h3o](https://github.com/HydroniumLabs/h3o).

This crate is mostly for sharing low-level primitives between the h3o crates,
thus the API is enriched on a need basis.
